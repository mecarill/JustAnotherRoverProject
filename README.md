# JARP - Just Another Rover Project

Just Another Rover Project, or **JARP**, is a personal project I started to start putting my 3D printer to use and to learn more about ROS and autonomous vehicles in general. 
This repository will contain the code to run JARP in ROS as well as the Solidworks/STL files for the rover itself. It will also contain some of the documentation related to this project.
